There once whas a pig who was the youngest of three that had sleep depervation because he was sad, sad the only home
he'd ever knew was taken from him in a breath of glory. He started a group with other pigs and with the strength of
commrodery, then all learned to belive in themselves ALOT. The pigs tried to take down society.


The littlest pig was over burdened with his new found philospohy. In fact he was no longer sure he was the littlest pig.
He no longer know who he was anymore, so much that he took to the streets to fright rich people with makeup on all in an
atempt to prove a point. He had to plan, he didn't one. He's in jail now.
