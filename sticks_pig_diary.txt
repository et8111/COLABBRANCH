	It is a time of great uncertainty in wherever the hell I live. 
My neighbor recently lost their house in an act of domestic terrorism 
and had no insurance to cover the loss. How Chase approved their 
mortgage without Homeowners Insurance is beyond me, but I digress. 

	While there is fear in my heart that I too will be a victim, I 
take solace in the fact that my home was built from structurally 
superior sticks. The loss of my neighbor's straw house was an accident 
waiting to happen.

	If something does happen to my home and by some miracle, I
survive, one of my other neighbors has graciously offered me space
inside his brick home. This may only offer a limited reprieve, but I'll
take it under the circumstances.
